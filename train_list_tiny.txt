<S> For those with live terrariums how well has this moss held up? Is it still alive? <SEP> I buy moss from this supplier regularly. I've never had any problem with any of the species, including the two I've been shipped under the name "sheet-moss." I terrariums for sale, but the few I've kept or given to friends as gifts are all still going strong & many are well over 24 months old at this point. </S>

<S> can you put this leaves in tea infuser and drink with hot water ? <SEP> Short answer: yes. Longer answer: i am trying it literally as I am typing this since that idea never came to me. the tea is very light in color so in the future i might mix it with other tea(s). But it does taste good. No off-notes of any kind </S>
<S> Do they taste good? <SEP> Uhhh- don't know. They were super cute & just went into a gift bag. Never tasted them. </S>
<S> Can anyone comment on the taste of lobster vs fish base? I've the fish base and absolutely love it. Wondering if I need both. thank you. <SEP> OMG, Yes!!! I make a lobster stew with it and I can't tell you how much better it is with the lobster base!!! And if you make anything "seafood" rather than "fish" or "clam", it get soooo much more flavor with this. YES, YES, YES, YES!!! It's a "must have" for any seafood dish. You may never go back to the fish. </S>
<S> why is your organic macadamia nut oil almost $73 for 16oz when the others are around $12 for the same size? <SEP> Because we want to sell to dumb asses </S>
<S> Expedited ONLY? Are these dry or fresh noodles? <SEP> I think they need to be refrigerated. </S>
<S> Are these the kernals, or in the shell? <SEP> They are in the shell. </S>
<S> Are Larabars considered a "raw" food? <SEP> Yes, they are. I don't know if all of them are, but the ones I've enjoyed are raw. Visit the Larabar Website and see the "Raw Diet" portion. http://www.larabar.com/about/special-diets </S>
<S> The sodium content says 11% per serving. I wonder if that includes the salt in the water or just in the meat? <SEP> I do not know why it has so much of a salty taste but I couldn't make it taste good by putting condiments; mayonnaises, pickles, or mustard. </S>
